# Android-GPS-Tracking
The Android app prompts the user to change the device location settings, if necessary, to allow the app to access precise location data. The app shows the device location as latitude and longitude coordinates, then shows the location as a physical address. The completed app does periodic location updates and shows an animation that gives the user a visual cue that the app is tracking the device's location.
